Always pick one of the 3 subfolders when adding a new project to this repo. This will make it easier to keep your work organized. 

It will also get you in the habit of consciously thinking about where/how your projects are stored. Eventually, for larger projects, you'll likely have a new repo for each new project instead of one repo for them all.
